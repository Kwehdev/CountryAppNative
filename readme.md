# Country App Native

This project is intended to be a React-Native of a prior project I had developed with Integrify.

[The repo can be found here](https://github.com/Kwehdev/CountryApp)

I have began this project to gain some experience using React-Native and Docker.

Note that this is currently a work in progress, though a rough image is presented below.
